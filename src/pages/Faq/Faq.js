                                Depending on your package, the images will be edited in our own signature style. But some pictures cannot be edited, and these are duplicate shots, test shots, and where people are blinking. Still, if you request any edits, such as swapping heads, removing large items, or any other things like this, then there will be additional charges as per the contract.
